# AI Shipping Container Solution

An AI solution for loading and unloading shipping containers built with Qt.

## Description

This program solves two shipping container problems: loading/unloading and balancing. Both problems are solved with a variant of A*, outputting the optimal solution quickly. Load the manifest of the current ship into the program, choose the problem, and follow the operations to optimally solve the transfer list.

### Loading / Unloading

For loading and unloading problems, choose which shipping containers to unload, or create new containers to load. Then follow the operations to optimally solve the transfer list.
